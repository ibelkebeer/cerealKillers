Record of over 240k gun violence incidents from 2013 to 2018

### Relevance/significance

Gun violence is becoming a more prevalent issue in the US, including school shootings.


## Visualization and User Interaction
<!-- Explanation, in broad strokes if necessary, of how you aim to make this data come alive.
What will be shown, absent user interaction? -->

A time lapse of gun violence incidents by state will be shown with the colors transitioning to suit the data for each month

<!-- How will user interact with your visualization? -->

The user can choose the type of frequency they want to depict the choropleth by such as if it represent frequency of incidents, injuries, or deaths.

Upon hovering over each state the user will be presented statistics of gun violence from that state.

## Questions
<!-- What questions will your visualization allow user to explore? What questions will it provoke? -->

- What are areas of mass gun violence?
- What makes these areas different from areas where gun violence is less common?
- Is the area Iâ€™m living in or planning to live in relatively safe from gun violence?

## D3 Utilization 
<!-- Explanation of D3 feature utilization:
enter/exit selections? -->

### Enter / Exit Selections

As we transition from one month to the next we will enter data from the next month while exiting data from the previous month to show a transition of time in our graph.

### Transitions
<!-- Transitions? -->
There will be a period from one month to the next in which the colors transition to suit the data for the new month.
responsiveness/interactivity?

When hovering over a state the user will be presented exact information on how many injuries/deaths were caused, how many incidents occurred, and how many incidents were cases with legal/stolen guns.
